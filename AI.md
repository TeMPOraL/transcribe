# Extra AI instructions
Here are stored extra guidelins for you.

## Vibe coding
This is a vibe-coded project. That is, I'm relying on you to do a good job here, I won't be touching the code myself if I can avoid it,
and I'm happy to embrace the directions you're giving. Whatever makes it work.

## Evolving your instruction set
If I tell you to remember something, behave differently, or you realize yourself you'd benefit from remembering some specific guideline,
please add it to this file (or modify existing guideline). The format of the guidelines is unspecified, except second-level headers to split
them by categories; otherwise, whatever works best for you is best. You may store information about the project you want to retain long-term,
as well as any instructions for yourself to make your work more efficient and correct.

## Project design
TBD.
